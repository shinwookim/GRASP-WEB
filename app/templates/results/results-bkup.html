        <strong>Summary</strong>
        <p class="text-left">
            The influence of the categorical variable on the regression model is minimal as indicated on the variable
            importance plot. Hence, using different combinations of these variables do not seem to yield any visible
            changes. On the other hand, for the classifier, the results of fixing the two categorical variables are
            huge. By using the hardest prediction combination, most of the classifier‚Äôs predictions are non-events.
            However, if we use the worst-case combinations, most of the predictions are events which seems to signify a
            high number of false positives. Indeed, in every case besides 100‚â§ùô∂‚â§150 we seem to get high proportions of
            events. Hence, we can clearly see that the predictive trends vary among the two combination choices (or any
            variances in the categorical variable as we saw in the above variable importance analysis). As for the
            regression‚Äôs surface plot, it suggests that the effects of the categorical variables are minimal in
            determining the predictions (which is backed by our analysis of the variable importance).</p>
